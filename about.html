      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My journey in the art world began while living in Botswana where I took up art in school as a subject from Cambridge University.</p>
      <p>In India I have completed a course from JJ school of Art, Mumbai. Colour composition, nature and more recently the human figure, inspire me, all these are depicted in my works.</p>
      <p>Currently I am working in oils, acrylics, charcoals and watercolorsâ€™; acrylics and charcoals being both my forte and passion.</p>
      <p>I enjoy playing around with acrylic inks on canvas and creating a plethora of textured backgrounds. </p>
      <p>I find it exciting to be able to twist the subject matter, nature or the human form, of interest, into abstraction and not something totally realistic.</p>
      <p>I have participated in several exhibitions and group shows every year since 2012.</p>
